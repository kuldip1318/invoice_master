# invoice_master
Invoice Master is an accounting application that processes hospital invoices. Users upload invoices, which are scanned using Azure OCR to extract data. OpenAI converts the extracted data into JSON, which is displayed in a table. Users can modify the data and save it as CSV/Excel or push it to a database.
